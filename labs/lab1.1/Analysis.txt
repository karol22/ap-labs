ANALISIS OF PERFORMANCE

We test the performance  using the file `testa.txt` that is attached to this text.

These are the results

Commands:

    > gcc -o cat2 cat2.c
    >time ./cat testa.txt

RESULTS:
real    0m9.665s
user    0m0.068s
sys     0m0.378s

Commands:

    > gcc -o cat cat.c
    >time ./cat testa.txt

RESULTS:
real    0m10.277s
user    0m0.066s
sys     0m0.405s

CONCLUSSION:

The original implementation has a better performance.
