Lab 1.1 - mycat

    Rewrite the cat.c program by using read, write, open and close instead of their library equivalents.
    Generate a report with performance metrics between the existing cat.c and your mycat.c. The format of the report is free, you can add charts or whatever helps to understand the speed of both approaches.
    
    How to run this program:
    type: `gcc -o cat cat.c`
    `./cat testa.txt`

    To test the performance you can check the Analyisis.txt file.
