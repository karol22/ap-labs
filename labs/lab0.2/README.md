Lab 0.2 - Strings Manipulation Library

To run this code, use the following commands for compilation and linking:
    gcc -c str-main.c -o str-main.o
    gcc -c strlib.c -o strlib.o
    gcc str-main.o strlib.o -o str-final.o

After that, look at the expected output:
    ./str-final.o originalVeryLongString Addition Add
    Initial Lenght      : 22
    New String          : originalVeryLongStringAddition
    SubString was found : yes
